# pyCRUD App
I made this simple CRUD app to help learn python and working with a SQL database. This app has no other use-case as-is beyond learning python concepts. 

## Setup

1. Use the supplied *example.env* as a template to make your own *.env*. Do this first.
2. Setup your own SQL database
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
4. Run `python pyCRUD.py` to start the app!
